Open Email Marketing Dataset
A curated dataset of 1,000 question-and-answer pairs focused on email marketing, lead generation, and data compliance. This dataset is designed for training large language models (LLMs), enhancing semantic search applications, and powering AI-driven chatbots.

This project was developed and published by LeadsBlue.com, a provider of verified B2B and B2C email databases.

Introduction
The Open Email Marketing Dataset provides a high-quality, specialized corpus of information for developers, AI researchers, and marketing professionals.
